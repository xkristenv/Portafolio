                <h1>Kristen Sofia Lopez Vargas</h1>
                <p>I am a creative individual who maintains composure during tense and stressful situations. I enjoy learning new topics and researching various solutions for projects and tasks. I always strive to give my best effort in every task and assignment I undertake, and I prefer to have them completed well in advance of the deadline.


                  <P>In group settings, I aim to foster good relationships with my colleagues to ensure that our collaborative efforts are not burdensome but rather an engaging and educational experience.</P>  
                    

                   <p>On a personal note, I have a deep appreciation for nature and enjoy going for walks. I find pleasure in visiting stores, exploring different items, and occasionally purchasing both large and small items, such as candies. I take delight in simply observing the variety of products available in different stores.
                    I am passionate about animals and feel an immediate urge to pet them whenever I encounter one. I also enjoy selecting aromatic candles based on their scents and appreciate the process of finding the perfect fragrance. Additionally, I find meditation and moments of relaxation, such as petting and playing with my dog, to be vital for disconnecting from the stress of daily life.
                   </p>
